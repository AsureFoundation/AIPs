What is an AIP?
--------------

AIP stands for Asure Improvement Proposal. An AIP is a design document providing information to the Asure community, 
or describing a new feature for Asure or its processes or environment. The AIP should provide a concise technical and business specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature. 
The AIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.
